<h3>Doraemon</h3>
<p>This is a very funny animation series about a robot from the future named Doraemon. 
   This robot was sent by Nobita's grand-grandson or something to help Nobita through every
    little bit of trouble. Nobita happened to be a lazy (but sometimes brilliant) boy who is madly
     in love with Shizuka, and has two friends: "Giant" Takeshi and Suneo. Whenever Nobita gets into
      trouble Doraemon always helps with a futuristic gadget which then is misused by Nobita and/or 
      his friends. </p>
<h3>Sword Art Online</h3>
<p>I would not call this anime a masterpiece but it really is something. 
   Surely there are better anime's out there. But if you like game and vr
    stuff then it's totally worth your time. I watched all 4 season. I didn't like 
    season 2&3 that much. But season 4 was a beast. As the release date is out I am waiting 
    for season 5. Although I think it's overhyped but you can enjoy.</p>
<h3>Overlord</h3>
<p>I'll start by saying it's a good watch overall. While the whole "being trapped in a video game" 
   thing is tired, this book adaptation does well in execution. The characters are well acted, the
    story lines interesting and complex (usually in a two-faced political sense), and most characters 
    likeable.</p>
